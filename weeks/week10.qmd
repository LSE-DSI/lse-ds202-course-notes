Welcome to Week 10 of DS202!

This week, you will get a chance to explore Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in the labs and I will also share a few (not-so-short) videos to help reinforce your theoretical understanding about PCA. 

In the lecture, we will continue to explore real-life applications of Machine Learning. In the first part of the lecture, I will show you a few examples of applications and in the second half, we will hear from [Dr. Stuart Bramwell](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Stuart-Bramwell/Stuart-Bramwell) and his research.

Join us on Friday, 2 December 2022 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at **NAB.LG.08**.
