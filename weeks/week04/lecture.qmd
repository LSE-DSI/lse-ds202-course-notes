# Topic: Resampling methods

There are no slides this week! Instead, you will form groups (of five people) and we will run a couple of live experiments together. 

- 📥 When the lecture starts, I will send a link on Slack. Follow the link to download the required files. 
- 💻 Bring your laptop or team up with someone who will bring one!

## If there are no slides, how do I revise this later?

- You can read all about resampling methods in our textbook, more specifically [@james_introduction_2021, Chapter 5].
- The RMarkdown you will use during the lecture will help you revise later, too.
