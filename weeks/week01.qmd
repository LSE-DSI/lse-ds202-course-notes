In this first week, we will cover what you can expect to learn from this course and the course logistics: all you need to know about the structure of the lectures, classes, assessments and how we will interact throughout this course. 

We will also cover some of the basics: what do we mean by data science & machine learning, and what do you need to do to get the most of this course?

## 💻 Labs

We do not have classes this week. Instead, we recommend you use this time to learn or revisit the basics of the programming language `R`.

See sections below for advice on how to do that.

## 📒 Preparing for the next week

- Join the Slack group of this course [(more info)](/communication.qmd)
- Use this time to learn or revisit basic `R` programming skills.
- Write down your `R` questions. Next week's lab, we have a roadmap for a revision of basic commands but we can tailor it to address any questions you might have with `R`.

## 🔖 Recommended Resources

- Checkout the upcoming book ['Modeling Mindsets'](https://book.modeling-mindsets.com/) [@molnar_modeling_2022] (it's free to read online) where you can learn about the different ways one can approach a modelling problem (traditional frequentist statistics vs Bayesian statistics vs Machine Learning, etc.). The following twitter thread also summarises the main points of these different paradigms:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a perfect world, you could effortlessly switch between modeling mindsets (statistics, machine learning, causal inference, ...).<br><br>Realistically, you only have time to master a few mindsets.<br><br>So what to do? A thread 🧵</p>&mdash; Christoph Molnar (\@ChristophMolnar) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristophMolnar/status/1564624829009072129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
- [Digital Skills Lab](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/digital-skills-lab) offer workshops on R and Python skills.
- Checkout this summer's [LSE Careers Skill Accelerator programme](https://twitter.com/LSECareers/status/1534868470495596545). Some of the self-paced courses will remain available until the end of the year.
