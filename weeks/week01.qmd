In this first week, we will cover what you can expect to learn from this course and the course logistics: all you need to know about the structure of the lectures, classes, assessments and how we will interact throughout this course. 

We will also cover some of the basics: what do we mean by data science & machine learning, and what do you need to do to get the most of this course?
