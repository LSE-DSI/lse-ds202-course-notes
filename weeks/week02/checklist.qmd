Your Checklist:

- 🖥️ Before you come to the class, skim through the [W02 lab roadmap page](https://lse-dsi.github.io/lse-ds202-course-notes/weeks/week02/lab.html) to have an idea of what we are going to do. 
- 👨‍💻 New to `R`? Or perhaps you are in one of the Monday sessions and struggled to follow the lab? There is still time to take the [R pre-sessional course](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=8366). (Read the **Getting access and using Dataquest** session carefully)
- 📚 Before you attend the lecture on Friday, try to catch up on the [recommended reading](https://lse-dsi.github.io/lse-ds202-course-notes/weeks/week01/appendix.html) of last week.
- 💻 Assess your own understanding: did you understand all the exercises of the lab?
- 📝 Take note of anything that is still not clear to you.
- 📟 Share your conceptual or programming-related questions on `#week02` channel on Slack.
- 📤 Have anything else to share? If came across an interesting resource for R beginners, or curious articles about exploratory data analysis, feel free to share it on `/week02` or `/random` channels in our Slack group.

Following this will keep you well prepared for the Linear Regression lab of [Week 03](/weeks/week03.qmd).
