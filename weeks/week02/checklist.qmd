Follow the suggested list of actions below to get the most out of this course:

# Your Checklist:

- 👨‍🏫 Attend the lecture. It will help you remember concepts more easily when revising later.

- 👨‍💻 New to `R`? We strongly recommend you have a look at the self-guided courses and workshops offered by [LSE Digital Skills Lab](/weeks/week01/appendix.html#lse-digital-skills-lab) before the first lab.

- 🖥️ Skim through the [lab roadmap page](/weeks/week02/lab.qmd). This week, we will do a recap of basic `R` programming plus some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of datasets we will be using throughout this course.

- 📙 Read [@james_introduction_2021, chapter 3] to reinforce your theoretical knowledge of Linear Regression.

- 👀 Browse the slides again.

- 💻 Replicate the R scripts used in the lecture.

- 📝 Take note of anything that is still not clear to you.

- 📟 Share your questions on `/week02` channel on Slack.

- 📤 Have anything else to share? Maybe you came across an interesting, curious, or perhaps [dangerous](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106) study or application of linear regression? Feel free to share it on `/week02` or `/random` channels in our Slack group.

Following this will keep you well prepared for the Linear Regression lab of [Week 03](/weeks/week03.qmd).
