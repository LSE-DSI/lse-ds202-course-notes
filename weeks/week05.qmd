Welcome to Week 05 of DS202!

In the labs, you will practice training/test splits, cross-validation and you will learn about the bootstrap. Check Chapter 5 of our textbook to reinforce these concepts during the week.

At the end of the week, we will explore two new algorithms: Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees. 

Starting this week, our lecture will take place in a new classroom. Join us this Friday, 28 October 2022 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at **NAB.LG.08**.
