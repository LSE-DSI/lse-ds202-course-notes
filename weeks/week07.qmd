title: "🗓️ Week 07 - Recap of tidyverse + Clustering Algorithms"
date: 04 November 2022

Welcome to Week 07 of DS202!

This week's lab draws on [🗓️ Week 05 lecture](/weeks/week05/lecture.qmd) content and on feedback given by the course representatives about the main struggles you are facing with R (tidyverse).

In the lecture, we will recap some tidyverse concepts -- things we wish we had taught you in the first weeks of this course! -- and then, on the second part, we will introduce the idea of unsupervised learning (clustering).

Join us on Friday, 11 November 2022 from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at NAB.LG.08.
