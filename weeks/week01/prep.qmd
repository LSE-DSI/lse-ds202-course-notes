## ðŸ’» Labs

We do not have classes this week. Instead, we recommend you use this time to learn or revisit the basics of the programming language `R`.

See sections below for advice on how to do that.

## ðŸ“’ Preparing for the next week

- Join the Slack group of this course [(more info)](/main/communication.qmd)
- Use this time to learn or revisit basic `R` programming skills.
- Write down your `R` questions. Next week's lab, we have a roadmap for a revision of basic commands but we can tailor it to address any questions you might have with `R`.
