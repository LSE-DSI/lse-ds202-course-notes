##  üéØ Questions

This question should be answered using the `Carseats` data set in `ISLR2` package.

1. Fit a multiple regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`, and `US`.

2. Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful‚Äîsome of the variables in the model are qualitative!

3. Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.

4. For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: Œ≤<sub>j</sub> = 0?

5. On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

6. How well do the models in question 1 and question 5 fit the data?

7. Using the model from question 5, obtain 95 % confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).

8. Use the `*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction effects:
