##  üéØ Questions

Use the `Carseats` data set in the `ISLR2` package to answer the following questions:

1. Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`, and `US`. Show the summary output.

2. Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful‚Äîsome of the variables in the model are qualitative!

3. Write the model in equation form, carefully handling the qualitative variables properly.

4. For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: Œ≤<sub>j</sub> = 0?

5. Based on your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of an association with the outcome. Justify your choices.

6. How well do the models in Questions 1 & 5 fit the data?

7. Using the model from question 5, obtain 95 % confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).

8. Use the `*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction effects. Could you find any model with interactions that fit better than the models you built in Questions 1 & 5? Justify your answer.
