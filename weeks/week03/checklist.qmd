Follow the suggested list of actions below to get the most out of this course:

# Your Checklist:

- 📙 Read [@james_introduction_2021, chapter 3] to reinforce your theoretical knowledge of Linear Regression. The textbook is available online for free.

- 🧑‍💻 If you already know linear regression from previous courses you have taken, why not take this knowledge to next level? 

    - Try to find a dataset online that contains a numerical variable you could predict by fitting a linear regression to it. I will be curious to see what you find. Share your findings on the `#week03` channel in our Slack.

- 🖥️ Before you come to the class, skim the [W03 lab roadmap page](https://lse-dsi.github.io/lse-ds202-course-notes/weeks/week03/lab.html) to have an idea of what we are going to do. 

    - This week, instead of just typing things in the terminal, we will use R Markdown. You can read about it [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). This is also how you will be submitting solutions to formative and summative assignments in the future.

    - I will post solutions to the practical exercises at the end of the week.

- 💻 Assess yourself: did you understand all the exercises in the lab?

    - If you are new to linear regression and you are enrolled in the Monday sessions, it is likely that you will struggle a bit in the lab. During the week, reserve some time to read about Linear Regression and then practice the exercises again. 

- 📟 Struggling with something? Don't know what a particular `R` command do? Share your questions on the `#week03` channel in our Slack.

    - I will also be posting follow up questions on Slack during the week.

- 📝 Keep in mind that: after the lecture on Friday, **14 October 2022**, we will post the first formative assignment on Moodle.
    
    - You will have until Thursday of the following week (20 October 2022) to submit your solutions.

    - This assignment is not marked, it doesn't count towards your final grade, but you will receive feedback if you submit.

    - The assignment will have a similar format as the questions we explore in the lab.

- 👨‍🏫 Attend the lecture. It will help you remember concepts more easily when revising later.
