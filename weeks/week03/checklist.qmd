Follow the suggested list of actions below to get the most out of this course:

# Your Checklist:

- 👨‍🏫 Attend the lecture. It will help you remember concepts more easily when revising later.

- 🖥️ Skim through the [lab roadmap page](/weeks/week03/lab.qmd). This week, we will practice some linear regression modelling.

- 📙 Read [@james_introduction_2021, chapter 4] to reinforce your theoretical knowledge of Classifiers.

- 👀 Browse the slides again.

- 💻 Replicate the R scripts used in the lecture.

- 📝 Take note of anything that is still not clear to you.

- 📟 Share your questions on `/week03` channel on Slack.

- 📤 What type of supervised learning method feels more useful to you? Regression or Classification? Share your thoughts on `/week03` or `/random` channels in our Slack group.

Pro-tip: If you take the time this week to read, practice, explore and experiment with linear and logistic regression, the concepts of resampling and cross-validation that will be introduced on [Week 04](/weeks/week04.qmd) and revisited on [Week 05's lab](/weeks/week05.qmd) will make A LOT more sense to you.
