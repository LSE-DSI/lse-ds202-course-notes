##  🔑 Solutions to formative homework

1. Fit a multiple regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`, and `US`.

    ```r
    > library(ISLR2)
    > lm.fit <- lm(Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)
    > summary(lm.fit)
    ``` 

2. Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!
   
   β<sub>1</sub>: Holding Urban and US fixed, the Sales decrease 54.459 units on average when the Price company charges for car seats at each site increases 1000 units.

   β<sub>2</sub>: Holding Price and US fixed, the Sales decrease 0.021916 units on average when the store is in urban area.

   β<sub>3</sub>: Holding Price and Urban fixed, the Sales increase 1.200573 units on average when the store is in US.

3. Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.
   
   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price + β<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>, when the store is in urban and in US

   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price + β<sub>3</sub>, when the store is not in urban and but in US

   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price + β<sub>2</sub>, when the store is in urban and but not in US

   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price, when the store is not in urban and not in US

4. For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>j</sub> = 0?

   From the p-values of t-test, we could reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>1</sub> = 0 for the predictor `Price` and the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>3</sub> = 0 for the predictor `US`. 

5. On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

    ```r
    > lm.fit1 <- lm(Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
    > summary(lm.fit1)
    ``` 

6. How well do the models in question 1 and question 5 fit the data?

   Neither model fits the data well according to the small value of R<sup>2</sup> and Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>. It means that the predictors included in both models can only interpret a small part of the change pattern of the response. 

7. Using the model from question 5, obtain 95 % confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).
   
    ```r
    > confint(lm.fit1)
        2.5 %      97.5 %
    (Intercept) 11.79032020 14.27126531
    Price       -0.06475984 -0.04419543
    USYes        0.69151957  1.70776632
    ``` 

    95% confidence interval for β<sub>0</sub> = [11.79032020, 14.27126531]; 95% confidence interval for β<sub>1</sub> = [-0.06475984 -0.04419543]; 95% confidence interval for β<sub>2</sub> = [0.69151957  1.70776632].
