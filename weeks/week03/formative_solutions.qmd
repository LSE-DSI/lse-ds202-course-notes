##  🔑 Solutions to formative homework

Use the `Carseats` data set in the `ISLR2` package to answer the following questions:

1. **Fit a multiple linear regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`, `Urban`, and `US`. Show the summary output.**

    ```r
    > library(ISLR2)
    > lm.fit <- lm(Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)
    > summary(lm.fit)
    ``` 

2. **Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be careful—some of the variables in the model are qualitative!**
   
   β<sub>1</sub>: Holding Urban and US fixed, the Sales decrease 54.459 units on average when the Price company charges for car seats at each site increases 1000 units.

   β<sub>2</sub>: Holding Price and US fixed, the Sales decrease 0.021916 units on average when the store is in urban area.

   β<sub>3</sub>: Holding Price and Urban fixed, the Sales increase 1.200573 units on average when the store is in US.

3. **Write the model in equation form, carefully handling the qualitative variables properly.**
   
   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price + β<sub>2</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>, when the store is in urban and in US

   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price + β<sub>3</sub>, when the store is not in urban and but in US

   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price + β<sub>2</sub>, when the store is in urban and but not in US

   Sales = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> x Price, when the store is not in urban and not in US

4. **For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>j</sub> = 0?**

   From the p-values of t-test, we could reject the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>1</sub> = 0 for the predictor `Price` and the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: β<sub>3</sub> = 0 for the predictor `US`. 

5. **Based on your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of an association with the outcome. Justify your choices.**

    ```r
    > lm.fit1 <- lm(Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
    > summary(lm.fit1)
    ``` 

6. **How well do the models in Questions 1 & 5 fit the data?**

   Neither model fits the data well according to the small value of R<sup>2</sup> and Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>. It means that the predictors included in both models can only interpret a small part of the change pattern of the response. 

7. **Using the model from question 5, obtain 95 % confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).**
   
    ```r
    > confint(lm.fit1)
        2.5 %      97.5 %
    (Intercept) 11.79032020 14.27126531
    Price       -0.06475984 -0.04419543
    USYes        0.69151957  1.70776632
    ``` 

    95% confidence interval for β<sub>0</sub> = [11.79032020, 14.27126531]; 95% confidence interval for β<sub>1</sub> = [-0.06475984 -0.04419543]; 95% confidence interval for β<sub>2</sub> = [0.69151957  1.70776632].

8. **Use the `*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction effects. Could you find any model with interactions that fit better than the models you built in Questions 1 & 5? Justify your answer.**
