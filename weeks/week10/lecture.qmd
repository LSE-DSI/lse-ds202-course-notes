## Info about this lecture

The original title of this week's lecture was _Applications: Predictive Modelling on Tabular Data_ but since we have been talking a lot about tabular data (in the context of supervised learning), we are going to bring diverse applications from our areas of expertise instead:

- In the first hour of the lecture, I will deliver a gentle introduction to the principles of network analysis, and I will demonstrate it using a software called [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).
    - Those of you pursuing degrees in Economics might be interested in the application of this type of techniques to the [networked dynamics of trade](https://oec.world/en/visualize/network/hs92/export/chl/all/show/2020/).
- In the second hour, Dr. [Stuart Bramwell](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Stuart-Bramwell/Stuart-Bramwell) will talk about his work on the [WhoGov dataset](https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/whogov-dataset/), and what this data tell us about cabinets around the world (autocracies vs democracies, the role of gender).
