Check out this [blog post](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/studentsatlse/2022/02/14/resisting-the-urge-to-overstudy-as-an-lse-student/) from Students@LSE blog.

I would definitely recommend you take a break during Week 06. After all, rest and [sleep can help you consolidate memories](https://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory) and improve your learning process.

However, if you feel like revisiting concepts you have learned so far, check out the Recommended Learning sections present in each week's sections here on our Moodle Page.

We will return with our lectures and classes on Week 07.
