	abstract = {Social media sites are now the most popular destination for Internet users, providing social scientists with a great opportunity to understand online behaviour. There are a growing number of research papers related to social media, a small number of which focus on personality prediction. To date, studies have typically focused on the Big Five traits of personality, but one area which is relatively unexplored is that of the anti-social traits of narcissism, Machiavellians and psychopathy, commonly referred to as the Dark Triad. This study explored the extent to which it is possible to determine anti-social personality traits based on Twitter use. This was performed by comparing the Dark Triad and Big Five personality traits of 2,927 Twitter users with their profile attributes and use of language. Analysis shows that there are some statistically significant relationships between these variables. Through the use of crowd sourced machine learning algorithms, we show that machine learning provides useful prediction rates, but is imperfect in predicting an individual's Dark Triad traits from Twitter activity. While predictive models may be unsuitable for predicting an individual's personality, they may still be of practical importance when models are applied to large groups of people, such as gaining the ability to see whether anti-social traits are increasing or decreasing over a population. Our results raise important questions related to the unregulated use of social media analysis for screening purposes. It is important that the practical and ethical implications of drawing conclusions about personal information embedded in social media sites are better understood.},

	abstract = {Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is about using regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately. Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with code available online. Graphics and presentation aid understanding of the models and model fitting.},

Having such a vague characterization of a field in the early stages might be natural, but over time maintaining such a broad definition becomes unwieldy and impedes progress. In particular, the teaching of data science is hampered by the seeming need to cover many different points of interest. Data scientists must ultimately identify the core of the field by determining what makes the field unique and what it means to develop new knowledge in data science. In this review we attempt to distill some core ideas from data science by focusing on the iterative process of data analysis and develop some generalizations from past experience. Generalizations of this nature could form the basis of a theory of data science and would serve to unify and scale the teaching of data science to large audiences.},
