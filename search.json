Perform train/test splits, cross-validation, bootstrap, and use appropriate measures of success to the problem you have at hand. Come to 🗓️ Week 04 workshop (the lecture) this Friday 21 October to learn more about this.\nThe reason I am saying all this is because p-values are very easy to hack. In fact, there is even a term for misuse of p-values in the scientific literature: p-hacking.\nWhere do I inform myself about this?\nI have separated a list of articles and commentaries about this topic. Check them out:\n\nNahm, Francis Sahngun. 2017. “What the P Values Really Tell Us.” The Korean Journal of Pain 30 (4): 241.\nAmrhein, Valentin, Sander Greenland, and Blake McShane. 2019. “Scientists Rise up Against Statistical Significance.” Nature 567 (7748): 305–7.\nAschwanden, Christie. 2015. “Science Isn’t Broken.” FiveThirtyEight.\nSterne, Jonathan A C, and George Davey Smith. 2001. “Sifting the Evidence—What’s Wrong with Significance Tests?” BMJ : British Medical Journal 322 (7280): 226–31.\n\n💡 If you are in a hurry and want to read just ONE thing, read the “Science Isn’t Broken.” piece at FiveThirtyEight.

More specifically:\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\operatorname{RSS}}{\\operatorname{TSS}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\operatorname{TSS}\\) represents the Total Sum of Squares:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{TSS} =  \\sum_i^n{\\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)^2},\n\\]\nand \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the mean of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\).\nAs for the \\(\\operatorname{RSS}\\), it represents the Residual Sum of Squares.\nTo understand why \\(R^2\\) can never decrease if we add more features, I think it is useful to visualise linear regression in matrix format."

What can we expect of \\(\\operatorname{RSS}_{(p=2)}\\) in relation to \\(\\operatorname{RSS}_{(p=1)}\\)? Let’s think through some scenarios:\nIf it turned out that \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_0 = \\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_1 = \\hat{\\beta}_1\\):\n\nIf \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_2 = 0\\), then we could conclude that \\(\\mathbf{e}' = \\mathbf{e}\\) and \\(\\operatorname{RSS}_{(p=2)} = \\operatorname{RSS}_{(p=1)}\\). That is, by minimising the sum of squares, OLS cannot find a better solution that involves \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_2\\).\nIf \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_2 \\neq 0\\) then notice that the new residuals are related to the previous ones: \\({e_i}' = (e_i - \\hat{\\beta}'_2x_{i2}) ~~\\forall i\\). That means \\(({e_i}')^2 \\geq e_i^2~~\\forall i\\) and therefore \\(\\operatorname{RSS}_{(p=2)} \\geq \\operatorname{RSS}_{(p=1)}\\).\n\nA similar logic applies to the case where \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_0 \\neq \\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}'_1 \\neq \\hat{\\beta}_1\\) — check 1 for a more formal proof."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBy adding a new feature, given the fact that OLS uses squares of errors, it is inevitable that \\(({e_i}')^2 \\geq e_i^2~~\\forall i\\). OLS will always find an equivalent or a lower \\(\\operatorname{RSS}\\) value. If you check the \\(R^2\\) definition once again, you will realise that \\(\\operatorname{TSS}\\) will never change — as it is not related to \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), only to \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) — only \\(\\operatorname{RSS}\\) can vary when you add new features. Since \\(\\operatorname{RSS}\\) can only decrease or stay the same, \\(R^2\\) will always increase or stay the same, never decrease, if you add more features.\nTo correct this misleading tendency of R-squared, an adjusted index has been proposed. The ajusted R-squared takes the number of features into account and it is what you should rely on when assessing the goodness-of-fit of a linear regression."

These problems can be modelled using classifiers, a type of supervised learning.\nThis week, we will explore two classifier algorithms: the Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes classifiers. We will learn how those methods relate (or not) to linear regression, and how to interpret its results. You will also meet a few new metrics and will learn of new ways to assess the ‘accuracy’ of models. These metrics will be incrediblly important on Week 04!\nJoin the lecture 14 October 2022 2pm at NAB LG.01 (Wolfson Theatre)."

    "text": "Step 1: Basic commands\nWe will follow the instructions below step by step together while answering whatever questions you might encounter along the way.\n\nOpen R or RStudio. You can either run the folllowing commands in a R script or in the console window.\nCreate a vetor of numbers with the function c() and name it x. When we type x, it gives us back the vector:\n> x <- c(1, 3, 2, 5)\n> x\n[1] 1 3 2 5\nNote that the > is not part of the command; rather, it is printed by R to indicate that it is ready for another command to be entered. We can also save things using = rather than <-:\n> x = c(1, 3, 2, 5)\nCheck the length of vector x using the length() function:\n> length(x)\n[1] 4\nCreate a matrix of numbers with the function matrix() and name it y. When we type y, it gives us back the matrix:\n> y <- matrix(data = c(1:16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)\n> y\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    5    9   13\n[2,]    2    6   10   14\n[3,]    3    7   11   15\n[4,]    4    8   12   16\nIf you want to learn about the meaning of some arguments like nrow or ncol:\n> ?matrix\nSelect one element in the matrix y:\n> y[2,3]\n[1] 10\nThe first number after the open-bracket symbol [ always refers to the row, and the second number always refers to the column\nSelect multiple rows and column at a time in the matrix y:\n> y[c(1, 3), c(2, 4)]\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    5   13\n[2,]    7   15\n> y[1:3, 2:4]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    5    9   13\n[2,]    6   10   14\n[3,]    7   11   15\n> y[1:2, ]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    5    9   13\n[2,]    2    6   10   14\n> y[-c(1, 3), ]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    2    6   10   14\n[2,]    4    8   12   16\nNo index for the columns or the rows indicates that R should include all columns or all rows, respectively. The use of a negative sign - in the index tells R to keep all rows or columns except those indicated in the index.\nCheck the number of rows and columns in a matrix:\n> dim(y)\n[1] 4 4\nGenerate a vector of random normal variables:\n> set.seed(1303)\n> x <- rnorm(50)\n> y <- x + rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = .1)\n> cor(x, y)\n[1] 0.9942128\nBy default, rnorm() creates standard normal random variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, the mean and standard deviation can be altered as illustrated above.\nEach time we call the function rnorm(), we will get a different answer. However, sometimes we want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers; we can use the set.seed() function to do this. We use set.seed() throughout the labs whenever we perform calculations involving random quantities.\nLet’s check some descriptive statistics of these vectors:\n> mean(y)\n[1] 50.18446\n> var(y)\n[1] 0.8002002\n> sqrt ( var (y))\n[1] 0.8945391\n> sd(y)\n[1] 0.8945391\n> cor (x, y)\n[1] 0.9942128\nThe mean() and var() functions can be used to compute the mean and variance of a vector of numbers. Applying sqrt() to the output of var() will give the standard deviation. Or we can simply use the sd() function. The cor() function is to compute the correlation between vector x and y."

However, each column should have the exactly same data type.\nWe can use the open-source data visualization package - ggplot2 to construct aesthetic mappings based on our data.\n\nSince tidyverse library includes ggplot2, if you install tidyverse you will have access to ggplot2; installation can be done;\n\n> install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nAlternatively, ggplot2 package can be installed\n\n> install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nAfter the installation is completed, it should be called in R environment:\n> library(ggplot2)\nThere are some ready datasets to play with in the package ggplot2. Let’s explore and plot a dataset called diamonds showing the prices and some features of over 50000 diamonds. You can explore the meanings of the variables with ?diamonds command.\nPlease type:\n> View(diamonds)\nthe View() function can be used to view it in a spreadsheet-like window.\nwe can plot this dataset with desired variables.\n > ggplot(diamonds[0:50,], aes(x=carat, y=price)) +\ngeom_point() + \ngeom_text(label=diamonds[0:50,]$cut)\nx and y in aes shows the axis which are the carat and the price info each diamond. diamonds is the dataframe used in the plot and We used only the first 50 lines for clear visualisation. geom_point defines the shape of data to be plot and geom_text adds the labels. With $ sign, you can access a column in your dataset.\nWe can also plot a histogram showing price\n > ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=price)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=100)\nThis time all dataset is used for the visualisation.. For more detailed information and some examples you can use ?ggplot and ?aes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Study - Heatmap Example\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a heatmap with ggplot2 package:\nThis time we will create a dummy dataframe with country names, a time period and random GDP for each country.\ncountries <- c(\"Canada\", \"France\",\"Greece\",\"Libya\",\"Malta\")\nyears <- c(2012:2021)\nLet’s gather them together and see what our dataframe looks like:\ndata <- expand.grid(Country=countries, Year=years)\ndata\nexpand.grid creates a dataframe from all combinations of the supplied vectors.\nto create random GPD for each country and for each year, and to add these values into our dataframe as GDP column::\ngdps  <- runif(50, min=20000, max=500000)\ndata$GDP = gdps\nrunif generates a certain number of random values between min and maximum values with a uniform distribution. Since we have 5 countries and 10 year, we generated 50 random GPD value.\nTo check the data and type of the variable data:\nView(data)\nclass(data)\nWe can plot now a very basic heatmap\nggplot(data, aes(Year, Country, fill= GDP)) + geom_tile()\nTo create a heatmap, our dataframe should look like a tabular dataset with three columns. aes defines X,Y axis and the values filling these pairs in the heatmap. geom_tile creates a heatmap with rectangulars with different options.

    "text": "Your Checklist:\n\n📙 Read (James et al. 2021, chap. 3) to reinforce your theoretical knowledge of Linear Regression. The textbook is available online for free.\n🧑‍💻 If you already know linear regression from previous courses you have taken, why not take this knowledge to next level?\n\nTry to find a dataset online that contains a numerical variable you could predict by fitting a linear regression to it. I will be curious to see what you find. Share your findings on the #week03 channel in our Slack.\n\n🖥️ Before you come to the class, skim the W03 lab roadmap page to have an idea of what we are going to do.\n\nThis week, instead of just typing things in the terminal, we will use R Markdown. You can read about it here. This is also how you will be submitting solutions to formative and summative assignments in the future.\nI will post solutions to the practical exercises at the end of the week.\n\n💻 Assess yourself: did you understand all the exercises in the lab?\n\nIf you are new to linear regression and you are enrolled in the Monday sessions, it is likely that you will struggle a bit in the lab. During the week, reserve some time to read about Linear Regression and then practice the exercises again.\n\n📟 Struggling with something? Don’t know what a particular R command do? Share your questions on the #week03 channel in our Slack.\n\nI will also be posting follow up questions on Slack during the week.\n\n📝 Keep in mind that: after the lecture on Friday, 14 October 2022, we will post the first formative assignment on Moodle.\n\nYou will have until Thursday of the following week (20 October 2022) to submit your solutions.\nThis assignment is not marked, it doesn’t count towards your final grade, but you will receive feedback if you submit.\nThe assignment will have a similar format as the questions we explore in the lab.\n\n👨‍🏫 Attend the lecture. It will help you remember concepts more easily when revising later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJames, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2021.

We can then select the best model out of all of the models we have considered.\nUsing the template below, try figuring out the model which produces the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\).

    "section": "Step 3: Some potential problems",
    "text": "Step 3: Some potential problems\nMany problems may occur when we fit a linear regression model to a particular data set. These problems will lead to inaccurate estimation. In this step, we will identify and overcome potential problems such as outliers, collinearity and interaction effects.\nWe present a few of the many methods available, but those interested can explore more after class.\n\nHandle interaction terms:\nIn regression, an interaction effect exists when the effect of an independent variable on the response variable changes, depending on the values of one or more independent variables. When you believe there is an interaction effect, it is easy to include interaction terms in a linear model using the lm() function.\n> tidy(lm(medv ~ lstat * age , data = Boston))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\nterm         estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n<chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept) 36.1        1.47      24.6    4.91e-88\n2 lstat       -1.39       0.167     -8.31   8.78e-16\n3 age         -0.000721   0.0199    -0.0363 9.71e- 1\n4 lstat:age    0.00416    0.00185    2.24   2.52e- 2\nThe syntax lstat:age tells R to include an interaction term between lstat and age. The syntax lstat*age simultaneously includes lstat, age, and the interaction term lstat×age as predictors; it is a shorthand for lstat+age+lstat:age.\nIdentify outliers through residual plots:\nAn outlier is a point for which \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is far from the value predicted by the model. Outliers can arise for a variety of reasons, such as incorrect recording of observation during data collection. Outliers could be identified through residual plots:\n> par(mfrow = c(2, 2))\n> plot(lm.fit)\nThe plot function automatically produces four diagnostic plots when you pass the output from lm(). Plots on the left column are residual plots, indicating the relationship between residuals and fitted values.\nIn practice, it can be difficult to decide how large a residual needs to be before we consider the point to be an outlier. Instead of plotting the residuals, we can address this problem by plotting the studentized residuals. These are computed by dividing each residual ei by its estimated standard studentized residual error. Observations with studentized residuals greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers. Using the plot() function to plot the studentized residuals:\n> plot(predict(lm.fit), rstudent(lm.fit)\nHandle outliers:\nIf we believe an outlier is due to an error in data collection or recording, then one solution is to simply remove the observation. However, care should be taken, as an outlier may instead signal a deficiency with our model, such as a missing predictor.\nDetect multicollinearity using the correlation matrix:\nMulticollinearity refers to the situation in which two or more predictor variables are highly correlated to one another. It can be detected through the correlation matrix:\ncor(Boston)\nIgnoring the last row and the last column in the matrix, which indicate the relationship with response variable medv, an element of this matrix that is large in absolute value indicates a pair of highly correlated variables, and therefore a collinearity problem in the data.\nWe can detect multicollinearity quantitatively using vif() function in the `car’ package:\ninstall.packages(\"car\"))\nlibrary(car)\n> vif(lm.fit)\nInstead of inspecting the correlation matrix, a better way to assess multicollinearity is to compute the variance inflation factor (VIF). As a rule of thumb, a VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about VIF\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our textbook (James et al. 2021, 99–103) for a description of the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).\n\n\n\n\nHandle collinearity:\nWhen faced with the problem of multicollinearity, there are two simple solutions.\n-The first is to drop one of the problematic variables from the regression.\n-The second solution is to combine the collinear variables into a single predictor, where such combination makes theoretical sense."

We have also recorded Volume (the number of shares traded on the previous day, in billions), Today (the percentage return on the date in question) and Direction (whether the market was Up or Down on this date). Our goal is to predict Direction (a qualitative response) using the other features.\nLet’s look at a generic summary of this data and how each pair of variables are related:\n\nsummary(Smarket)\n\n      Year           Lag1                Lag2                Lag3          \n Min.   :2001   Min.   :-4.922000   Min.   :-4.922000   Min.   :-4.922000  \n 1st Qu.:2002   1st Qu.:-0.639500   1st Qu.:-0.639500   1st Qu.:-0.640000  \n Median :2003   Median : 0.039000   Median : 0.039000   Median : 0.038500  \n Mean   :2003   Mean   : 0.003834   Mean   : 0.003919   Mean   : 0.001716  \n 3rd Qu.:2004   3rd Qu.: 0.596750   3rd Qu.: 0.596750   3rd Qu.: 0.596750  \n Max.   :2005   Max.   : 5.733000   Max.   : 5.733000   Max.   : 5.733000  \n      Lag4                Lag5              Volume           Today          \n Min.   :-4.922000   Min.   :-4.92200   Min.   :0.3561   Min.   :-4.922000  \n 1st Qu.:-0.640000   1st Qu.:-0.64000   1st Qu.:1.2574   1st Qu.:-0.639500  \n Median : 0.038500   Median : 0.03850   Median :1.4229   Median : 0.038500  \n Mean   : 0.001636   Mean   : 0.00561   Mean   :1.4783   Mean   : 0.003138  \n 3rd Qu.: 0.596750   3rd Qu.: 0.59700   3rd Qu.:1.6417   3rd Qu.: 0.596750  \n Max.   : 5.733000   Max.   : 5.73300   Max.   :3.1525   Max.   : 5.733000  \n Direction       day        \n Down:602   Min.   :   1.0  \n Up  :648   1st Qu.: 313.2  \n            Median : 625.5  \n            Mean   : 625.5  \n            3rd Qu.: 937.8  \n            Max.   :1250.0  \n\n\n\npairs(Smarket)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.2 Initial exploratory data analysis\nProduce a matrix that contains all of the pairwise correlations among the predictors in a data set:\n\ncor(Smarket[, -9])\n\n             Year         Lag1         Lag2         Lag3         Lag4\nYear   1.00000000  0.029699649  0.030596422  0.033194581  0.035688718\nLag1   0.02969965  1.000000000 -0.026294328 -0.010803402 -0.002985911\nLag2   0.03059642 -0.026294328  1.000000000 -0.025896670 -0.010853533\nLag3   0.03319458 -0.010803402 -0.025896670  1.000000000 -0.024051036\nLag4   0.03568872 -0.002985911 -0.010853533 -0.024051036  1.000000000\nLag5   0.02978799 -0.005674606 -0.003557949 -0.018808338 -0.027083641\nVolume 0.53900647  0.040909908 -0.043383215 -0.041823686 -0.048414246\nToday  0.03009523 -0.026155045 -0.010250033 -0.002447647 -0.006899527\nday    0.97977289  0.035414677  0.036022487  0.038988767  0.041437137\n               Lag5      Volume        Today        day\nYear    0.029787995  0.53900647  0.030095229 0.97977289\nLag1   -0.005674606  0.04090991 -0.026155045 0.03541468\nLag2   -0.003557949 -0.04338321 -0.010250033 0.03602249\nLag3   -0.018808338 -0.04182369 -0.002447647 0.03898877\nLag4   -0.027083641 -0.04841425 -0.006899527 0.04143714\nLag5    1.000000000 -0.02200231 -0.034860083 0.03502515\nVolume -0.022002315  1.00000000  0.014591823 0.54634793\nToday  -0.034860083  0.01459182  1.000000000 0.03527333\nday     0.035025152  0.54634793  0.035273325 1.00000000\n\n\nThe function cor() can only take quantitative variables. Because the Direction variable is qualitative, therefore we exclude it when calculating the correlation matrix.\nAs one would expect, the correlations between the lag variables and today’s returns are close to zero. In other words, there appears to be little correlation between today’s returns and previous days’ returns. The only substantial correlation is between Year and Volume. We could explore how Volume changed chronologically.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(data = Smarket, aes(x = day, y = Volume)) +\n    geom_col(fill=\"#665797\") +\n\n    ggtitle(\"Volume of shares traded over the period of this dataset\") +\n\n    xlab(\"Day\") + ylab(\"Volume (in billion US dollars)\") +\n\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(aspect.ratio = 2/5)\n\n\n\n\nBy plotting the data, which is ordered chronologically, we see that Volume is increasing over time. In other words, the average number of shares traded daily increased from 2001 to 2005."

    "text": "Step 2: Logistic Regression\nWe will still use the Smarket data set to fit a Logistic Regression Model to predict Direction.\n\nStep 2.1 Separate some data just for training\nBuild a training and a testing dataset. In practice we will be interested in our model’s performance not on the data that we used to fit the model, but rather on days in the future for which the market’s movements are unknown. Therefore, we will first create a training data set corresponding to the observations from 2001 through 2004. We will then create a testing data set of observations from 2005.:\n\ntrain <- (Smarket$Year < 2005)\nSmarket.before.2005 <- Smarket [ train , ]\n\nSmarket.2005 <- Smarket[ Smarket$Year==2005, ]\nDirection.2005 <- Smarket$Direction [ Smarket$Year==2005 ]\n\nSmarket$Year < 2005 returns True for the values satisfying <2005 (smaller than 2005) condition in Year column in Smarket dataset. The same logic can be applied to >, <= , >=, ==(equal) or != (not equal).\nTo access corresponding rows, we can create a vector (train) and put it in open brackets to make it more readable and reusable, or we can explicitly specify in the open brackets.\nUsing Smarket[ Smarket$Year==2005,] gives all the rows satisfying this condition with all columns. The same logic can be applied to < , >, <= , >= or != (not equal).\nSmarket$Direction [ Smarket$Year==2005 ] tells the direction values corresponding to the rows equal to 2005 in the year column are requested.\nThus, we can construct a training data set named Smarket.before.2005, and a testing data set named Smarket.2005.\nHow many observations we have in the training set (< 2005)?\n\nnrow(Smarket.before.2005)\n\n[1] 998\n\n\nWhat about the test set (2005)?\n\nnrow(Smarket.2005)\n\n[1] 252\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.2 Fit a logistic regression model\nFit a Logistic Regression Model in order to predict Direction using Lag1 through Lag5 and Volume based on training data set:\n\nglm.fits <- \n    glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + Volume, \n        data = Smarket.before.2005, family = binomial)\n\nThe generalized linear model syntax of the glm() function is similar to that of lm(), except that we must pass in the argument family = binomial in order to tell R to run a logistic regression rather than some other type of generalized linear model.\nWe now fit a logistic regression model using only the subset of the observations that correspond to dates before 2005, using the subset argument.\n\n\nStep 2.3 Inspect the model\nHave a look at p-values of this Logistic Regression Model:\n\nsummary(glm.fits)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2 + Lag3 + Lag4 + Lag5 + \n    Volume, family = binomial, data = Smarket.before.2005)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n   Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  \n-1.302  -1.190   1.079   1.160   1.350  \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

The negative coefficient for this predictor suggests that if the market had a positive return yesterday, then it is less likely to go up today. However, at a value of 0.295, the p-value is still relatively large, and so there is no clear evidence of a real association between Lag1 and Direction. So do other predictors.\n\n\nStep 2.4 Make predictions about the future (2005)\nObtain predicted probabilities of the stock market going up for each of the days in our testing data set, that is, for the days in 2005:\n\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fits, Smarket.2005, type = \"response\") \nglm.probs[1:10]   \n\n      999      1000      1001      1002      1003      1004      1005      1006 \n0.5282195 0.5156688 0.5226521 0.5138543 0.4983345 0.5010912 0.5027703 0.5095680 \n     1007      1008 \n0.5040112 0.5106408 \n\n\nThe predict() function can be used to predict the probability that the market will go up, given values of the predictors. The type = \"response\" option tells R to output probabilities of the form P(Y = 1|X), as opposed to other information such as the logit. If no data set is supplied to the predict() function, then the probabilities are computed for the training data set that was used to fit the logistic regression model. Here we have printed only the first ten probabilities.\n\ncontrasts(Smarket$Direction)\n\n     Up\nDown  0\nUp    1\n\n\nWe know that these values correspond to the probability of the market going up, rather than down, because the contrasts() function indicates that R has created a dummy variable with a 1 for Up.\nIn order to make a prediction as to whether the market will go up or down on a particular day, we must convert these predicted probabilities into class labels, Up or Down. The following commands create a vector of class predictions based on whether the predicted probability of a market increase is greater than or less than 0.5.\n\nglm.pred <- rep(\"Down\", 252)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] <- \"Up\"\n\nThe first command creates a vector of 252 Down elements. The second line transforms to Up all of the elements for which the predicted probability of a market increase exceeds 0.5.\n\n\nStep 2.5 Create a confusion matrix\nConstruct confusion matrix in order to determine how many observations in testing data set were correctly or incorrectly classified.\n\ntable(glm.pred, Direction.2005)    \n\n        Direction.2005\nglm.pred Down Up\n    Down   77 97\n    Up     34 44\n\n\nGiven the predictions, the table() function can be used to produce a confusion matrix in order to determine how many observations were correctly or incorrectly classified.\n\n\nStep 2.6 What is the error in the test set?\nCalculate the test set error rate:\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.4801587\n\n\n\nmean(glm.pred != Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5198413\n\n\nThe != notation means not equal to, and so the last command computes the test set error rate. The results are rather disappointing: the test error rate is 52%, which is worse than random guessing! Of course this result is not all that surprising, given that one would not generally expect to be able to use previous days’ returns to predict future market performance.\n\n\nStep 2.7 Can we find a better combination of features?\nRemove the variables that appear not to be helpful in predicting Direction and fit a new Logistic Regression model. We recall that the logistic regression model had very underwhelming p-values associated with all of the predictors, and that the smallest p-value, though not very small, corresponded to Lag1. Perhaps by removing the variables that appear not to be helpful in predicting Direction, we can obtain a more effective model. After all, using predictors that have no relationship with the response tends to cause a deterioration in the test error rate (since such predictors cause an increase in variance without a corresponding decrease in bias), and so removing such predictors may in turn yield an improvement.\n\nglm.fits <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2, \n                data = Smarket.before.2005, family = binomial)\nsummary(glm.fits)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = Direction ~ Lag1 + Lag2, family = binomial, data = Smarket.before.2005)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n   Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  \n-1.345  -1.188   1.074   1.164   1.326  \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)\n(Intercept)  0.03222    0.06338   0.508    0.611\nLag1        -0.05562    0.05171  -1.076    0.282\nLag2        -0.04449    0.05166  -0.861    0.389\n\n(Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)\n\n    Null deviance: 1383.3  on 997  degrees of freedom\nResidual deviance: 1381.4  on 995  degrees of freedom\nAIC: 1387.4\n\nNumber of Fisher Scoring iterations: 3\n\n\n\nglm.probs <- predict(glm.fits, Smarket.2005, type = \"response\")\nglm.pred <- rep(\"Down\", 252)\nglm.pred[glm.probs > .5] <- \"Up\"\ntable(glm.pred , Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nglm.pred Down  Up\n    Down   35  35\n    Up     76 106\n\n\n\nmean(glm.pred == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5595238\n\n\nCheck proportion:\n\n106 / (106 + 76)\n\n[1] 0.5824176\n\n\nAbove we have refit the logistic regression using just Lag1 and Lag2, which seemed to have the highest predictive power in the original logistic regression model.\nNow the results appear to be a little better: 56% of the daily movements have been correctly predicted. It is worth noting that in this case, a much simpler strategy of predicting that the market will increase every day will also be correct 56% of the time! Hence, in terms of overall error rate, the logistic regression method is no better than the naive approach However, the confusion matrix shows that on days when logistic regression predicts an increase in the market, it has a 58% accuracy rate. This suggests a possible trading strategy of buying on days when the model predicts an increasing market, and avoiding trades on days when a decrease is predicted. Of course one would need to investigate more carefully whether this small improvement was real or just due to random chance.\nSuppose that we want to predict the returns associated with particular values of Lag1 and Lag2. In particular, we want to predict Direction on a day when Lag1 and Lag2 equal 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, and on a day when they equal 1.5 and −0.8. We do this using the predict() function.\n\npredict(glm.fits, \n        newdata = data.frame (Lag1 = c(1.2, 1.5), Lag2 = c(1.1, -0.8)), \n        type = \"response\")\n\n        1         2 \n0.4791462 0.4960939 \n\n\n\n\nStep 2.8 Logistic regression siblings\nIn this lab we used the glm() function with family = binomial to perform logistic regression. Other choices for the family argument can be used to fit other types of GLMs. For instance, family = Gamma fits a gamma regression model. You can alwarys use the following command to explore more about family argument and possible choices.\n?glm()"

By default, this implementation of the naive Bayes classifier models each quantitative feature using a Gaussian distribution. However, a kernel density method can also be used to estimate the distributions.\nThe output contains the estimated mean and standard deviation for each variable in each class. For example, the mean for Lag1 is 0.0428 for Direction=Down, and the standard deviation is 1.23. We can easily verify this:\n\nmean(Smarket$Lag1[train][Smarket$Direction[train] == \"Down\"])\n\n[1] 0.04279022\n\n\n\nsd(Smarket$Lag1[train][Smarket$Direction[train] == \"Down\"])\n\n[1] 1.227446\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.2 Predict the test set\nPredict Direction in testing data set:\n\nnb.class <- predict(nb.fit, Smarket.2005)\ntable(nb.class, Direction.2005)\n\n        Direction.2005\nnb.class Down  Up\n    Down   28  20\n    Up     83 121\n\n\n\nmean(nb.class == Direction.2005)\n\n[1] 0.5912698\n\n\nThe predict() function is straightforward. From the confusion matrix, Naive Bayes performs very well on this data, with accurate predictions over 59% of the time. This is better than Logistic Regression Model.\nThe predict() function can also generate estimates of the probability that each observation belongs to a particular class.\n\nnb.preds <- predict(nb.fit, Smarket.2005, type = \"raw\")\nnb.preds[1:5, ]\n\n          Down        Up\n[1,] 0.4873164 0.5126836\n[2,] 0.4762492 0.5237508\n[3,] 0.4653377 0.5346623\n[4,] 0.4748652 0.5251348\n[5,] 0.4901890 0.5098110"

If the distribution of a predictor significantly varies with the response variable, then it may contribute to the prediction of response variable. If the distribution of a predictor does not significantly differ between different values of the response variable, then it may not contribute to the prediction of response variable. The boxplots suggest that cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight might be the most useful in predicting mpg01. The function par() is used to change the layout of output plots.\nTo visualise the association between mpg01, year and origin, scatterplot is used.\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\nplot(Auto$year, Auto$mpg)\nabline(h = median(Auto$mpg), lwd = 2, col = \"red\")\nThe above scatterplot of mpg vs year shows that the newer cars in the data set tend to be more fuel efficient. Therefore, while manufacture year might not be as useful as the other four quantitative variables, it still seems worth including.\nplot(Auto$origin, Auto$mpg, xlab = \"Origin\", ylab = \"mpg\")\nabline(h = median(Auto$mpg), lwd = 2, col = \"red\")\nLastly, when looking at a boxplot that compares the mpg values for each car, categorized by country of origin, we see that there is a clear difference between American cars, which tend to have below-median fuel efficiency, and European and Japanese cars, which tend to have above-median fuel efficiency. Thus, it seems that origin will also be useful in predicting mpg01.\nIn conclusion, all of the predictors except for acceleration and name will be used in fitting this classification model for trying to predict mpg01. Also, mpg will be excluded because that was directly used to create the classification label.\nSplit the data into a training set and a test set. Train set contains observations before 1979.

Justify your choice.\nAfter comparing the test errors, these two classification models were equally good. To further compare the performance of these two model, we have to look at the confusion matrix and find these two classification models have identiical confusion matrix. It means that Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F-Score of these two models are all same. Therefore, we can conclude that these two classification models have equally good performace on this data set. One thing that should be cautious of is that the data set is imbalnced. Therefore, we cannot judge the performance of this data set based on test error.

    "text": "Step 1: The Validation Set Approach\nIn this step, we will explore how to extract the subset of the whole dataset as a training dataset, and then estimate the test error rates of various linear models. The dataset is Auto from the ISLR2 package.\n\nStep 1.1: Training vs Testing splits\nSplit the Auto dataset into two halves, as randomly selecting 196 observations out of the original 392 observations. We performed splits using base R in the last lab. However, this can be done more easily using the rsample package. We first create a split object Auto.split using prop = 0.5 to specify a \\(50\\%/50\\%\\) train/test split. We also specify strata = mpg as we want our train/test split to have a similar mean/standard deviation for mpg. We then create dataframes using the training and testing functions.\n\nlibrary(ISLR2)\nlibrary(rsample)\n\nset.seed(1) # Just so you and I have the same \"random\" numbers.\n\nAuto.split <- initial_split(Auto, prop = 0.5, strata = mpg)\nAuto.train <- training(Auto.split)\nAuto.test <- testing(Auto.split)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout set.seed()\n\n\n\n\n\nset.seed() is important here as it set a seed for the random number generator. Literally, the same results will be replicated in the following steps. Further information can be found in the official documentation.Seeding Random Variate Generators\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.2: How good is your model at predicting the test set?\nFit a linear regression model using the training dataset (Auto.train), making the mpg as the dependent variable(x) and horsepower as the independent variable(y). Then, using the fitted model to estimate the mpg from Auto.test. Finally, calculating the MSE of the 196 observations in the validation set.\n\n# use the lm() function to fit a linear regression model\nlm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto.train)\n\n# estimate the 'mpg' values by the lm.fit model\nlm.pred <- predict(lm.fit, Auto.test)\n\n# calculate MSE\nmean((Auto.test$mpg - lm.pred)^2)\n\n[1] 25.58657\n\n\nTherefore, we have estimated the test MSE for the linear regression model, \\(\\mathbf{25.59}\\). (Well Done! 💪 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get help in R\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are ever in doubt of what a particular R function do, you can consult the R documentation for it by using ?.\nFor example, you have been using lm and predict but you want to see what other arguments/parameters this function can take, just type ?lm or ?predict in your console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to access or create columns in R?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn base R, you generally use the $ sign to access columns or create new columns.\n\n#You can see all the values from the 'mpg' column.\nAuto$mpg\n\n  [1] 18.0 15.0 18.0 16.0 17.0 15.0 14.0 14.0 14.0 15.0 15.0 14.0 15.0 14.0 24.0\n [16] 22.0 18.0 21.0 27.0 26.0 25.0 24.0 25.0 26.0 21.0 10.0 10.0 11.0  9.0 27.0\n [31] 28.0 25.0 19.0 16.0 17.0 19.0 18.0 14.0 14.0 14.0 14.0 12.0 13.0 13.0 18.0\n [46] 22.0 19.0 18.0 23.0 28.0 30.0 30.0 31.0 35.0 27.0 26.0 24.0 25.0 23.0 20.0\n [61] 21.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 14.0 17.0 11.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 19.0 15.0 13.0 13.0 14.0\n [76] 18.0 22.0 21.0 26.0 22.0 28.0 23.0 28.0 27.0 13.0 14.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 12.0\n [91] 13.0 13.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 18.0 16.0 18.0 18.0 23.0 26.0 11.0 12.0 13.0\n[106] 12.0 18.0 20.0 21.0 22.0 18.0 19.0 21.0 26.0 15.0 16.0 29.0 24.0 20.0 19.0\n[121] 15.0 24.0 20.0 11.0 20.0 19.0 15.0 31.0 26.0 32.0 25.0 16.0 16.0 18.0 16.0\n[136] 13.0 14.0 14.0 14.0 29.0 26.0 26.0 31.0 32.0 28.0 24.0 26.0 24.0 26.0 31.0\n[151] 19.0 18.0 15.0 15.0 16.0 15.0 16.0 14.0 17.0 16.0 15.0 18.0 21.0 20.0 13.0\n[166] 29.0 23.0 20.0 23.0 24.0 25.0 24.0 18.0 29.0 19.0 23.0 23.0 22.0 25.0 33.0\n[181] 28.0 25.0 25.0 26.0 27.0 17.5 16.0 15.5 14.5 22.0 22.0 24.0 22.5 29.0 24.5\n[196] 29.0 33.0 20.0 18.0 18.5 17.5 29.5 32.0 28.0 26.5 20.0 13.0 19.0 19.0 16.5\n[211] 16.5 13.0 13.0 13.0 31.5 30.0 36.0 25.5 33.5 17.5 17.0 15.5 15.0 17.5 20.5\n[226] 19.0 18.5 16.0 15.5 15.5 16.0 29.0 24.5 26.0 25.5 30.5 33.5 30.0 30.5 22.0\n[241] 21.5 21.5 43.1 36.1 32.8 39.4 36.1 19.9 19.4 20.2 19.2 20.5 20.2 25.1 20.5\n[256] 19.4 20.6 20.8 18.6 18.1 19.2 17.7 18.1 17.5 30.0 27.5 27.2 30.9 21.1 23.2\n[271] 23.8 23.9 20.3 17.0 21.6 16.2 31.5 29.5 21.5 19.8 22.3 20.2 20.6 17.0 17.6\n[286] 16.5 18.2 16.9 15.5 19.2 18.5 31.9 34.1 35.7 27.4 25.4 23.0 27.2 23.9 34.2\n[301] 34.5 31.8 37.3 28.4 28.8 26.8 33.5 41.5 38.1 32.1 37.2 28.0 26.4 24.3 19.1\n[316] 34.3 29.8 31.3 37.0 32.2 46.6 27.9 40.8 44.3 43.4 36.4 30.0 44.6 33.8 29.8\n[331] 32.7 23.7 35.0 32.4 27.2 26.6 25.8 23.5 30.0 39.1 39.0 35.1 32.3 37.0 37.7\n[346] 34.1 34.7 34.4 29.9 33.0 33.7 32.4 32.9 31.6 28.1 30.7 25.4 24.2 22.4 26.6\n[361] 20.2 17.6 28.0 27.0 34.0 31.0 29.0 27.0 24.0 36.0 37.0 31.0 38.0 36.0 36.0\n[376] 36.0 34.0 38.0 32.0 38.0 25.0 38.0 26.0 22.0 32.0 36.0 27.0 27.0 44.0 32.0\n[391] 28.0 31.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.3: Does it get better if I modify the features using polynomial terms?\nRepeat the second part to estimate the test error for the quadratic and cubic regressions.\n\nlm.fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2), data = Auto.train)\n\n\nmean((Auto.test$mpg - predict(lm.fit2, Auto.test))^2)\n\n[1] 19.08374\n\n\n\nlm.fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 3), data = Auto.train)\nmean((Auto.test$mpg - predict(lm.fit3, Auto.test))^2)\n\n[1] 19.00317\n\n\n💡 We can see a model that predicts mpg using a quadratic function of horsepower performs better than a model that involves only a linear function of horsepower. Furthermore, we see that adding a cubic function of horsepower actually increases MSE when compared to the quadratic function. Thus, the quadratic function of horsepower appears to perform the best out of all the functions considered.\n\n\nStep 1.4: Visualisation\nWant to see how well does the quadratic fit maps onto the raw data?\nLet’s create a scatter plot with horsepower on the x-axis and mpg on the y-axis. Now, we can predict mpg using lm.fit2 and specify interval = 'confidence' to get \\(95\\%\\) confidence intervals. Along with geom_line we can use geom_ribbon to plot the line of best fit and associated confidence intervals. Remember to specify alpha so that we can see the predicted value - otherwise the ribbon will not be translucent.\n\n    library(tidyverse)\n\n    sim.data <- data.frame(horsepower = 46:230)\n\n    sim.pred <- predict(lm.fit2, sim.data, interval = 'confidence') \n\n    sim.data <- cbind(sim.data, sim.pred)\n\n    ggplot(data = sim.data, aes(x = horsepower, y = fit)) +\n        geom_point(data = Auto, aes(x = horsepower, y = mpg)) +\n        geom_line() +\n        geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr), alpha = 0.125, fill = 'blue') +\n        theme_minimal() +\n        labs(x = 'Horsepower', y = 'MPG')"

For the sake of simplicity we will look at the relationship between weight and horsepower which appears to be linear.\nCreate a function as boot.fn() which\n\nboot.fn <- function(data, index) {\n\n    lm(horsepower ~ weight, data = data[index,])$coefficients\n\n}  \n\nboot.fn simply returns a vector of coefficient estimates. It takes two parameters: data and index. data is a placeholder for the dataframe used in the model. index is a placeholder for the sample used to subset the dataframe. Other than this, the body of the function should look familiar. We are estimating a linear model where we are looking to predict horsepower by weight, and then extracting the coefficients.\nNow, compare the results from bootstrap estimates and the standard estimates\n\n# bootstrap with 1000 times\n\nboot(Auto, boot.fn, 1000)\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot(data = Auto, statistic = boot.fn, R = 1000)\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n        original        bias    std. error\nt1* -12.18348470  1.659517e-01 3.221766853\nt2*   0.03917702 -6.479214e-05 0.001251433\n\n\n\nsummary(lm(horsepower ~ weight, data = Auto))$coef\n\n                Estimate  Std. Error   t value      Pr(>|t|)\n(Intercept) -12.18348470 3.570431493 -3.412328  7.115312e-04\nweight        0.03917702 0.001153214 33.972031 1.364347e-118\n\n\nWe can find that in the bootstrap estimation process, \\(\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{0}) = 3.5704\\) and \\(\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{1}) = 0.0012\\) , while in the standard estimation process, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{Intercept}=-12.1835\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{horsepower}=0.0392\\).\nTo get a better intuition of what the bootstrap algorithm does let’s create a ggplot. We can get the intercepts and slopes estimated and overlay them on a scatterplot (weight on x-axis, horsepower on y-axis). We will create 50 bootstrap resamples for ease of visualisation and use geom_abline to overlay all the lines of best fit.\n\nboot.model <- boot(Auto, boot.fn, 50)\n\nboot.df <- as.data.frame(boot.model$t)\nnames(boot.df) <- c('b0','b1')\n\nggplot(data = Auto, aes(x = weight, y = horsepower)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_abline(data = boot.df,\n                aes(intercept = b0, slope = b1), \n                alpha = 0.1, colour = 'blue') +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    labs(x = 'Weight (lbs.)', y = 'Engine horsepower')"

You can do this by predicting that the first observation will go up if \\(P(\\text { Direction }=' U p ' \\mid \\operatorname{Lag} 1, \\text { Lag2 })>0.5\\). Was this observation correctly classified? \n\n    # methods 1\n    > predict(log_dir_2, Weekly[1, ])\n    > Weekly[1, ]\n\n    # methods 2\n    > ifelse(predict(log_dir_2, newdata = Weekly[1, ], type = \"response\") > 0.5, \"Up\", \"Down\")\n\nWriting a LOOCV Loop- Write a for loop from i = 1 to i = n, where n is the number of observations in the data set, that performs each of the following steps:\n\nFit a logistic regression model using all but the ith observation to predict Direction using Lag1 and Lag2.\nCompute the posterior probability of the market moving up for the i th observation.\nUse the posterior probability for the i th observation in order to predict whether or not the market moves up.\nDetermine whether or not an error was made in predicting the direction for the i th observation.
