These problems can be modelled using classifiers, a type of supervised learning.\nThis week, we will explore two classifier algorithms: the Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes classifiers. We will learn how those methods relate (or not) to linear regression, and how to interpret its results. You will also meet a few new metrics and will learn of new ways to assess the ‘accuracy’ of models. These metrics will be incrediblly important on Week 04!"

You can either run the folllowing commands in a R script or in the console window.\nCreate a vetor of numbers with the function c() and name it x. When we type x, it gives us back the vector:\n> x <- c(1, 3, 2, 5)\n> x\n[1] 1 3 2 5\nNote that the > is not part of the command; rather, it is printed by R to indicate that it is ready for another command to be entered. We can also save things using = rather than <-:\n> x = c(1, 3, 2, 5)\nCheck the length of vector x using the length() function:\n> length(x)\n[1] 3\nCreate a matrix of numbers with the function matrix() and name it y. When we type y, it gives us back the matrix:\n> y <- matrix(data = c(1:16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)\n> y\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    5    9   13\n[2,]    2    6   10   14\n[3,]    3    7   11   15\n[4,]    4    8   12   16\nIf you want to learn about the meaning of some arguments like nrow or ncol:\n> ?matrix\nSelect one element in the matrix y:\n> y[2,3]\n[1] 10\nThe first number after the open-bracket symbol [ always refers to the row, and the second number always refers to the column\nSelect multiple rows and column at a time in the matrix y:\n> y[c(1, 3), c(2, 4)]\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    5   13\n[2,]    7   15\n> y[1:3, 2:4]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    5    9   13\n[2,]    6   10   14\n[3,]    7   11   15\n> y[1:2, ]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    5    9   13\n[2,]    2    6   10   14\n> y[-c(1, 3), ]\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    2    6   10   14\n[2,]    4    8   12   16\nNo index for the columns or the rows indicates that R should include all columns or all rows, respectively. The use of a negative sign - in the index tells R to keep all rows or columns except those indicated in the index.\nCheck the number of rows and columns in a matrix:\n> dim(y)\n[1] 4 4\nGenerate a vector of random normal variables:\n> set.seed(1303)\n> x <- rnorm(50)\n> y <- x + rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = .1)\n> cor(x, y)\n[1] 0.9942128\nBy default, rnorm() creates standard normal random variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, the mean and standard deviation can be altered as illustrated above.\nEach time we call the function rnorm(), we will get a different answer. However, sometimes we want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers; we can use the set.seed() function to do this. We use set.seed() throughout the labs whenever we perform calculations involving random quantities.\nLet’s check some descriptive statistics of these vectors:\n> mean(y)\n[1] 50.18446\n> var(y)\n[1] 0.8002002\n> sqrt ( var (y))\n[1] 0.8945391\n> sd(y)\n[1] 0.8945391\n> cor (x, y)\n[1] 0.9942128\nThe mean() and var() functions can be used to compute the mean and variance of a vector of numbers. Applying sqrt() to the output of var() will give the standard deviation. Or we can simply use the sd() function. The cor() function is to compute the correlation between vector x and y."

Variable name is qualitative varibale.\nUse the function range() to check the range of each quantitative predictor:\n> range(Auto$mpg)\n[1]  9.0 46.6\nor\n> attach(Auto)\n> range(mpg)\n[1]  9.0 46.6\nTo refer to a variable, we must type the data set and the variable name joined with a $ symbol. Alternatively, we can use the attach() function in attach() order to tell R to make the variables in this data frame available by name.\nUsing summary() to have an overall look at all variables and statistical features (like mean and standard deviation) are included in the outputs:\n> summary(Auto)\nor\n> mean(Auto$mpg)\n> sd(Auto$mpg)\nRemove 10th observation from the original data frame and store it as another new data frame:\n> Auto_tmp = Auto[1:9, ]\n> summary(Auto_tmp)\n> mean(Auto_tmp$mpg)\n> sd(Auto_tmp$mpg)\nCreate a scatterplot matrix using the function pairs():\n> pairs( ~ mpg + displacement + horsepower + weight + \n        acceleration + year + origin + cylinders, \n        data = Auto)\nNotice the linear or non-linear trends in the scatterplots.Then create a histogram of the variable mpg:\n> hist (Auto$mpg , col = 2, breaks = 15)\nUse the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative variables. You may find the command par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) useful: it will divide the print window into four regions so that four plots can be made simultaneously. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways.\nAfter observing the first row of the scatterplot matrix which indicates the relationship between gas mileage (mpg) and other variables, you will find evident linear or non-linear trends exist in the scatterplots with variables displacement, horsepower, weight, year and origin. Therefore, these varibles might be useful in predicting mpg.\n\nIf you want to achieve ststistical robust when exploring the relationship between variables, you need to culculate some statistics (like the correlation using the function cor()) and conduct statistical tests. This will be further illustrated in Week 03."

This week, we will practice some linear regression modelling.\n📙 Read (James et al. 2021, chap. 4) to reinforce your theoretical knowledge of Classifiers.\n👀 Browse the slides again.\n💻 Replicate the R scripts used in the lecture.\n📝 Take note of anything that is still not clear to you.\n📟 Share your questions on /week03 channel on Slack.\n📤 What type of supervised learning method feels more useful to you? Regression or Classification? Share your thoughts on /week03 or /random channels in our Slack group.\n\nPro-tip: If you take the time this week to read, practice, explore and experiment with linear and logistic regression, the concepts of resampling and cross-validation that will be introduced on Week 04 and revisited on Week 05’s lab will make A LOT more sense to you.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJames, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2021.

    "text": "Inappropriate reliance on metrics\n\n\nAccuracy can be very misleading when classes are imbalanced\nConsider the following model: \\(\\hat{y} = \\text{Yes}\\) (always)\n\nOnly \\(3\\%\\) of customers default on their credit cards\nTherefore, this model would have a \\(97\\%\\) accuracy!\nIt is correct ninety-seven percent of times. But is it a good model?\n\n🙅‍♂️ NO!\n\n\nSimilarly, you have to ask yourself about the usefulness of any other metric\n\nIs True Positive Rate more or less important than True Negative Rate for the classification problem at hand?\nWhy? Why not?\n\nUltimately, it boils down to how you plan to use this model afterwards."
