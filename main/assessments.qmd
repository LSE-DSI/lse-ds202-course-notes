# List of assessments

This course is assessed by a mix of problem sets and final exam. You can find the details below:

## üìù Problem Sets (60%)

-   Summative problem sets released on **Weeks 5, 8 & 11**.
-   These will have a similar style to the formative problem sets, a mix of `R` tasks and your written interpretation of the analyses.
-   Typically, you will have 4-6 days to submit your solutions.
-   Each of the three summative problem sets is worth 20% of the final mark, and will be graded on a 100 point scale.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Exam (40%)

-   An open-book online exam.
-   3 hours for working on the exam + 1 hour for submission.
-   Exam questions will be comparable in style to the problem sets, but will require less writing of R code.
-   The exam questions will be released on Moodle sometime in the [Exam Period](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/services/assessment-and-results/exams/exam-timetable). Our exact timeslot has not yet been confirmed by LSE Exams team.
