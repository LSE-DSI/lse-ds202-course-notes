This course is assessed by a mix of problem sets and final exam. You can find the details below:

## üìù Problem Sets (60%)

-   Summative problem sets released on **Weeks 5, 8 & 11**.
-   These will have a similar style to the formative problem sets, a mix of `R` tasks and your written interpretation of the analyses.
-   Typically, you will have 4-6 days to submit your solutions.
-   Each of the three summative problem sets is worth 20% of the final mark, and will be graded on a 100 point scale.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Exam (40%)

-   An open-book take-home exam, taken during the January exams period.
-   Exam questions will be comparable in style to the problem sets.
-   The exam questions will be released on Moodle

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Import Update 11/10/2022

Last year, DS202 exam was performed entirely online due to COVID-19 mitigation procedures. We want to run it online via our own Moodle page again this academic term, we just need to understand LSE regulations about exams for this year. 

We will update you on this very soon (hopefully by the end of W04).
