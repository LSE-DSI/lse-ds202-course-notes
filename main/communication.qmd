# üìü Communication

Find out how to reach out to your peers, teaching and administrative staff during this course.

## ![](/figures/logos/slack_logo_simple.svg){height="1em" fig-align="left" fig-alt="Slack logo"} Slack

- Most of our "informal" communication and interactions will happen through Slack. 
- Slack is a platform used by many companies and institutions where teams can collaborate and communicate about a specific project. 
- There will be channels dedicated to discussing each week's content, a channel for sharing useful links and events, plus a random channel to share random stuff about data science.

You will receive an invitation to join our Slack group via e-mail. 
Send an [e-mail to Jon](mailto:J.Cardoso-Silva@lse.ac.uk) if you have not received an invite by the time of the first lecture. 

Check out the following links to understand more about this tool:

## üó®Ô∏è Office Hours

-   It is probably a good idea to book office hours if:
    -   you struggled with a technical or theoretical aspect of a problem set in the previous week,
    -   you have queries about careers in data science,
    -   you want guidance in how to apply data science to other things you are studying outside this course.
-   Come prepared. You only have 15 minutes.
-   Ask for help sooner rather than later.
-   Book slots via StudentHub up to 12 hours in advance.


‚ö†Ô∏è Reserve üìß e-mail for **formal requests**: extensions, deferrals, etc. No need to e-mail to inform you will skip a class, for example.
