## What is Machine Learning?

-  **Machine learning** refers to a vast set of tools for *understanding data*.
-  For a quantitative response $Y$ and a set of predictors $X$:
$$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon 
$$
::: {.incremental}
-  Here, $f$ represents the *systematic* information that $X$ provides about $Y$. 
-  Statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating $f$.

## What is Machine Learning?

-  Most of the course we'll spend talking about different ways to estimate $f$ and how to evaluate whether we've done a good job with it.
