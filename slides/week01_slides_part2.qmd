# What do we mean by data science?

## Data science is...

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *"\[...\] a field of study and practice that involves the **collection**, **storage**, and **processing** of data in order to derive important 💡 **insights** into a problem or a phenomenon.*
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *Such data may be generated by **humans** (surveys, logs, etc.) or **machines** (weather data, road vision, etc.),*
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *and could be in **different formats** (text, audio, video, augmented or virtual reality, etc.)."*

-   Social science: The goal is typically **explanation**
-   Data science: The goal is frequently **prediction**, or data exploration
-   Many of the same methods are used for both objectives

## What is Machine Learning?

-  **Machine learning** refers to a vast set of tools for *understanding data*.
-  For a quantitative response $Y$ and a set of predictors $X$:
$$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon 
$$
::: {.incremental}
-  Here, $f$ represents the *systematic* information that $X$ provides about $Y$. 
-  Statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating $f$.

## What is Machine Learning?

-  Most of the course we'll spend talking about different ways to estimate $f$ and how to evaluate whether we've done a good job with it.
