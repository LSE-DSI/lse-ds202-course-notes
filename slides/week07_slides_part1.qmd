## The rationale

Our expectations for this problem set:

::: incremental

- we knew it would require somewhat considerable time effort
- encourage people to collaborate and work together
- put what you learned from the R pre-sessionals to practice
- we wanted to allow for some freedom

## Our blind spots {.smaller}

What we could have done better:

::: incremental
- we assumed the pre-sessional chapter above would have prepared you even for the challenging questions
   - data types & data frames
   - `if`-`else` statements
   - `for`-loops
   - creation of `functions`
   - vectorized functions like `apply()` and `sapply`
- we could have provided a **cheatsheet** for common `R` tasks
- we could have given better marking criteria for questions where more freedom was allowed

## Next summative {.smaller}

Operational changes we plan to introduce:

::: incremental
- Less code writing and more code **reading**
- Reduce ambiguity. 
   - Where freedom/creativity is allowed, explain if and how this is rewarded
- Elements of randomness. Each student will be assigned a unique combination of:
   - **selected variables** and 
   - **selected metrics** to consider

## Next summative {.smaller}

**Topics of Summative W08-W10:**

- Regression & Classification
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- k-fold Cross-Validation

# Tidyverse tutorial

- live demos
- if studying from the slides, you will have to watch the lecture recording.
