- It is important to understand the ideas behind the various techniques, in order to know how and when to use them.
- One has to understand the simpler methods first, in order to grasp the more sophisticated ones.
- It is important to accurately assess the performance of a method, to know how well or how badly it is working (simpler methods often perform as well as fancier ones!).
