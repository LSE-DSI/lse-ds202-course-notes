- It is important to understand the ideas behind the various techniques, in order to know how and when to use them.
- One has to understand the simpler methods first, in order to grasp the more sophisticated ones.
- It is important to accurately assess the performance of a method, to know how well or how badly it is working (simpler methods often perform as well as fancier ones!).

- This is an exciting research area, having important applications in science, industry and policy.
- Machine learning is a fundamental ingredient in the training of a modern **data scientist**.

## What is Machine Learning?

-  **Machine learning** refers to a vast set of tools for *understanding data*.
-  For a quantitative response $Y$ and a set of predictors $X$:
$$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon 
$$
::: {.incremental}
-  Here, $f$ represents the *systematic* information that $X$ provides about $Y$. 
-  Statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating $f$.

## What is Machine Learning?

-  Most of the course we'll spend talking about different ways to estimate $f$ and how to evaluate whether we've done a good job with it.

- Social science: The goal is typically **explanation**
- Data science: The goal is frequently **prediction**, or data exploration
- Many of the same methods are used for both objectives
