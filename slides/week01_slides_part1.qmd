# Learning Objectives

::: incremental
- Understand the **fundamentals of the data science approach**, with an emphasis on social scientific analysis and the study of the social, political, and economic worlds;
- Understand how **classical methods** such as regression analysis or principal components analysis can be treated **as machine learning approaches** for prediction or for data mining.
- Know how to fit and apply **supervised machine learning models** for classification and prediction.
:::

## Learning Objectives (cont.)

::: incremental
- Know how to evaluate and **compare fitted models**, and to improve model performance.
- Use applied computer programming, including the **hands-on use of programming** through course exercises.
- Apply the methods learned to **real data** through hands-on exercises.
- Integrate the insights from data analytics into **knowledge generation** and **decision-making**;
:::

## Learning Objectives (cont.)

- Understand an introductory framework for working with **natural language (text) data** using techniques of machine learning.

::: {.fragment}
- Learn how data science methods have been applied to a particular domain of study (**applications**).
:::

# Philosophy of this course

::: incremental
-   It is important to understand **the ideas behind the various techniques**, in order to know how and when to use them.
-   One has to **understand the simpler methods first**, in order to grasp the more sophisticated ones.
-   It is important to accurately **assess the performance of a method**, to know how well or how badly it is working (simpler methods often perform as well as fancier ones!).
:::

# What do you need to know to get the most of this course? 

## The basics of statistics

Basic concepts of Statistics you might want to recap:

::: incremental
-   Expected value, mean, median, variance, standard deviation
-   Probabilities and simple probability distributions
-   Types of data
    -   discrete vs continuous
    -   categorical vs numerical vs ordinal
:::

## Resources (Stats)

A few references that might be useful to read or skim through:

- [@warne_statistics_2018, chapters 1-3,5,6,11-12]
- [@gelman_regression_2020, chapters 1-4]
- If you are a PBS student, you can revisit the content of <br/>[PB130](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=6446) (MT3, MT4, MT8-MT11)


## The basics of `R` programming

Basic concepts of programming in `R` to recap:

::: incremental
-   data structures (vectors, matrices, data frames)
-   how to manipulate data (filter, subset, select)
-   read/write data files (for example: CSV, JSON, TXT)
-   *(optional but encouraged)* some knowledge `tidyverse` can give you a productive boost
    - the official website [(tidyverse.org)](https://www.tidyverse.org/) has some good tutorials.
:::


## Resources (`R`)

- Check out *"R for Data Science"* [@wickham_r_2016, chapters 1-21]. The online version is free.
- *"Statistical inference via data science"* [@ismay_statistical_2020, chapters 4-6] is another great free resource

## 'What if I struggle with `R`'?

‚û°Ô∏è Our first lab (Week 02) is a recap of some basic `R` commands, plus some ggplot2.

::: incremental
- If you are not confident with your `R` skills, I strongly encourage you invest in studying the basics in the next couple of weeks. 
- Contact [LSE Digital Skills Lab](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/digital-skills-lab) to attend in-person workshops or self-paced online R courses.

## Structure of lectures üë®üèª‚Äç:school:

Our lectures will be split in two parts:

::: incremental
-   Part I (\~ 50 min): Traditional exposition of theoretical content
-   break (\~ 10 min): Grab coffee :coffee: or relax :lotus_position:
-   Part II (\~ 50 min): Live demo
    -   Typically, an exploratory analysis or application of an algorithm
    -   Feel free to follow along in your own laptops.
:::

## Structure of classes :woman_technologist:

::: incremental
-   Students will work on weekly, structured problem sets in the staff-led class sessions.
-   Tips to get the most of classes:
    -   Bring your own laptops :computer: (most tablets are not suitable for programming)
    -   Read the recommended reading prior to the class
    -   Skim through the problem set before class
:::

## Class groups

<mark class="todo"> Update the groups here once we hear back from LSE Timetables</mark>

## Assessments :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

The breakdown of assessment for this class will be as follows:

## Assessments :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

<br/>

### Problem sets (60%)

::: incremental
-   Summative problem sets released on **Weeks 5, 8 & 11**.
-   These will have a similar style to the formative problem sets, a mix of `R` tasks and your written interpretation of the analyses.
-   You will have 4-6 days to submit your solutions.
-   Each of the three summative problem sets is worth 20% of the final mark, and will be graded on a 100 point scale.
:::

## Assessments :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

<br/>

### Take-home exam (40%)

::: incremental
-   An open-book take-home exam, taken during the January exams period.
-   Exam questions will be comparable in style to the problem sets.
-   The exam questions will be released on Moodle on <mark>5 January 2023.</mark>
-   The exam is due on <mark>11 January at 4pm</mark>.
:::

## Office hours

::: incremental
-   It is probably a good idea to book office hours if:
    -   you struggled with a technical or theoretical aspect of a problem set in the previous week,
    -   you have queries about careers in data science,
    -   you want guidance in how to apply data science to other things you are studying outside this course.
-   Come prepared. You only have 15 minutes.
-   Ask for help sooner rather than later.
-   Book slots via StudentHub up to 12 hours in advance.
:::

## Communication

::: incremental
-   Join our Slack group: <mark class="todo"> add link to slack</mark>
-   Use the public Slack channels to talk to share links, content (or *memes*) with your colleagues.
-   Our teaching team will dedicate some time during the week to answer questions or other interactions on Slack.
-   Reserve :email: e-mail for **formal requests**: extensions, deferrals, etc.
    -   No need to e-mail to inform you will skip a class, for example.

# How did we get here? 

::: notes
- and how did we get to the point that we can collect, extract and analyse all of this data?
- Well, this abundance of data is strongly associated with the dramatic changes in technology we have experienced recently.
- Take a look of the technology people were using back in 2005. 
- This photo was taken outside St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican at the time Ratzinger was ordained as pope
- Now, fast forward to 2013 ‚Äî only 8 years later ‚Äî when Pope Francis was elected the new pope, and you will see a lot of bright screens. 
- Our habits have changed
