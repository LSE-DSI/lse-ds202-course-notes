# 📑 Course Brief

**Focus:** learn and understand the most fundamental machine learning algorithms

**How:** practical use of machine learning techniques and its metrics, applied to relevant data sets

# 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the **fundamentals of the data science approach**, with an emphasis on social scientific analysis and the study of the social, political, and economic worlds;
- Understand how **classical methods** such as regression analysis or principal components analysis can be treated **as machine learning approaches** for prediction or for data mining.
- Know how to fit and apply **supervised machine learning models** for classification and prediction.
- Know how to evaluate and **compare fitted models**, and to improve model performance.
- Use applied computer programming, including the **hands-on use of programming** through course exercises.
- Apply the methods learned to **real data** through hands-on exercises.
- Integrate the insights from data analytics into **knowledge generation** and **decision-making**.
- Understand an introductory framework for working with **natural language (text) data** using techniques of machine learning.
- Learn how data science methods have been applied to a particular domain of study (**applications**).
