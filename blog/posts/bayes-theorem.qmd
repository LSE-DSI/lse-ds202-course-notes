This video will help you grasp the intuition behind Bayes' Theorem. 

On [Week 03](/weeks/week03/lecture.qmd) (Part II), I showed you the following equation and mentioned that it forms the basis for one of the algorithms we explore in this course, Naive Bayes.

$$
P(\mathbf{Y} = k | \mathbf{X} = x) = \frac{P(k)P(\mathbf{X}|\mathbf{Y}=k)}{\sum_{l=1}^{K}{P(l)P(\mathbf{X}|\mathbf{Y}=l)}}
$$

The following video might help you understand the intuition behind the equation. Enjoy!
