## TLDR

There are dangers in relying too much on p-values.

:::

When you run a linear or logistic regression and find out that a regression coefficient has a low associated p-value, it is tempting to scream _THIS FEATURE IS SIGNIFICANT AND I CAN PROVE_!

In reality, although p-values _might suggest_ a non-zero relationship between variables, you shouldn't judge the performance or explainability of a model simply by the p-values of coefficients, nor the p-value associated with the full model (say, the F-statistic). 

When assessing a model, look beyond goodness-of-fit. Perform train/test splits, cross-validation, bootstrap, and use appropriate measures of success to the problem you have at hand. Come to [üóìÔ∏è Week 04](/weeks/week04.qmd) workshop (the lecture) this Friday 21 October to learn more about this.

The reason I am saying all this is because p-values are very easy to hack. In fact, there is even a term for misuse of p-values in the scientific literature: _p-hacking_.
