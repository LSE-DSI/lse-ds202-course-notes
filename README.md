# DS202 - Data Science for Social Scientists

[Quarto project](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html) containing Course Notes for DS202, updated Summer 2022.

## üìë Course Content

Data science and machine learning are exciting new areas that combine scientific inquiry, statistical knowledge, substantive expertise, and computer programming. One of the main challenges for businesses and policy makers when using big data is to find people with the appropriate skills. Good data science requires experts that combine substantive knowledge with data analytical skills, which makes it a prime area for social scientists with an interest in quantitative methods.

This module extends the foundation of probability and statistics with an introduction to the most important concepts in data science and applied machine learning, with social science examples.

It will cover the main analytical methods from this field with hands-on applications using example datasets, so that students gain experience with and confidence in using the methods we cover. At the end of this module, students will have a sound understanding of the field of data science, the ability to analyse data using some of its main methods, and a solid foundation for more advanced or more specialised study.

The topics covered include:

-   the fundamentals of the data science approach, with an emphasis on social scientific analysis and the study of the social, political, and economic worlds;
-   a survey of the methods of statistical learning, and its link to more classical methods of probability and statistical inference;
-   an introduction to machine learning, including common supervised and unsupervised methods;
-   methods of evaluating and improving model performance;
-   computer programming, including the hands-on use of programming through course exercises;
-   applications to real data through hands-on exercises;
-   how to integrate the insights from data analytics into knowledge generation and decision-making;
-   an introduction to natural language processing and text analysis;
-   data visualisation through a variety of graphs.

The applications are drawn from social, political, economic, legal, and business and marketing fields.

The final week of the module will cover several applications of data science for a specific discipline, designed to link the module to specific different groups of students.
