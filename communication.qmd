- Most of our "informal" communication and interactions will happen through Slack. 
- Slack is a platform used by many companies and institutions where teams can collaborate and communicate about a specific project. 
- There will be channels dedicated to discussing each week's content, a channel for sharing useful links and events, plus a random channel to share random stuff about data science.

You will receive an invitation to join our Slack group via e-mail. 
Send an [e-mail to Jon](mailto:J.Cardoso-Silva@lse.ac.uk) if you have not received an invite by the time of the first lecture.
